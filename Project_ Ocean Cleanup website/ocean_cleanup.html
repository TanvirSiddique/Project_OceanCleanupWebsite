                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p> <em>The Ocean Cleanup</em> is a nonprofit engineering environmental organization based in the
                        Netherlands,
                        founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat, a Dutch-born inventor-entrepreneur of Croatian and
                        Dutch origin who serves as its CEO.
                        It develops technology to extract plastic pollution from the oceans
                        and intercept it in rivers before it can reach the ocean.
                        The organization conducts scientific research into oceanic plastic pollution.
                        It has conducted two expeditions to the North Pacific Gyre,
                        the Mega Expedition and the Aerial Expedition, and continues to publish scientific papers.

                    <h2>Marine Plastic Debris</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is estimated that there is a stock of 86 million tons of plastic marine debris
                        in the worldwide ocean as of the end of 2013, assuming that 1.4% of global plastics produced
                        from 1950 to 2013 has entered the ocean and has accumulated there.
                        8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each year.
                        Asia was the leading source of mismanaged plastic waste,
                        with China alone accounting for 2.4 million metric tons.
                        In 2017 the UN estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans,
                        if substantial measures are not taken.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Plastic waste has reached all the world's oceans.
                        However, it has been found that plastic debris concentrates in the oceanic gyres
                        where it forms extensive garbage patches.
                        Of those, the North Pacific garbage patch is the biggest,
                        with an estimated area of 1.6 million square kilometers.
                        Plastic accumulating in these patches photodegrades into smaller and smaller particles and
                        releases toxic and endocrine chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plastic pollution harms an estimated 100,000 sea turtles and marine mammals
                        and 1,000,000 sea creatures each year.
                        Larger plastics (called "macroplastics") such as plastic shopping bags
                        can clog the digestive tracts of larger animals when consumed by them and
                        can cause starvation through restricting the movement of food,
                        or by filling the stomach and tricking the animal into thinking it is full.
                        Microplastics on the other hand harm smaller marine life.
                        For example, pelagic plastic pieces in the center of our oceanâ€™s gyres outnumber
                        live marine plankton,
                        and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life as well as human consumers.

                        In 2011, aged 16, Dutch Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece.
                        He decided to devote a high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution
                        and why it was considered impossible to clean up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Slat discontinued his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to devote his time to developing
                        his
                        idea.
                        He founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013. The group's mission is to develop advanced technologies
                        to rid the world's oceans of plastic.
                        In June 2014, the Ocean Cleanup published
                        a 528-page feasibility study about the project's potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Ocean Cleanup is mainly funded by donations and sponsors.
                        As of November 2019 it has made a little over $35 million from sponsors including
                        Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, philanthropist Peter Thiel, Julius Baer Foundation
                        and Royal DSM. The Ocean Cleanup raised over $2 million with the help of a crowdfunding campaign
                        in 2014.

                            The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized in the ocean gyres.
                            These structures act as a containment boom.
                            The floater drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine debris.
                            A permeable screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris.
                            The system is unmanned and incorporates solar-powered monitoring and navigation systems,
                            including GPS, cameras, lanterns and an automatic identification system (AIS)
                            for vessel traffic services.

                            <em>System 001</em>, deployed in September 2018, consisted of a 800 meters long barrier with
                            a 3
                            meters
                            wide skirt that hangs beneath it.
                            System 001 encountered difficulties retaining the plastic collected. After two month of
                            operation,
                            during which the system had collected 2,000 kilograms of plastic, mechanical stress caused

                            redesign,
                            the
                            organization employed <em>System 001/B</em> which could successfully capture and collect

                            The organization is now developing <em>System 003</em>,
                            which is planned to have a three times bigger plastic intake than the current design.
                            Unlike the previous prototypes,
                            this new system is meant to be a blueprint for an entire fleet of filtering systems
                            able to meet the scale of the problem.

                            Responding to criticism that filtering devices closer to shore are easier to maintain,
                            and likely to recover more plastic per dollar spent,
                            the organization introduced an additional technology in October 2019 -- the River
                            Interpector.
                            Solar-powered Interceptor vessels use floating arms to direct floating waste into the
                            collection
                            conveyor,
                            which dumps trash into dumpsters on a detachable barge below.
                            When full, the collection stops until the barge is removed,
                            emptied and returned to the Interceptor.
                        </p>

                            As of October 2022, The Ocean Cleanup enterntains eight Interceptors in Indonesia,
                            Malaysia, Viet Nam, Dominican Republic, USA and Jamaica.

                        <p>
                            In October 2020, The Ocean Cleanup launched their first product made from plastic collected
                            from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,<em>The Ocean Cleanup Sunglasses</em>.
                            The organization worked with DNV GL to develop a certification for plastic from water
                            sources
                            and the sunglasses were certified to originate from the GPGP.
                            Revenue from the sale of recycling products go into their continued cleanup projects.
